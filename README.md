# My personal Nat Table exercises

This project contains my personal NAT Table Exercises. It is only meant for my personal documeantation.
The source contains and references the NatTableExample.jar (NAT Table Example Application) from https://www.eclipse.org/nattable/documentation.php?page=examples_application

## Preparation to run the code
Download NatTableExamples.jar from https://www.eclipse.org/nattable/documentation.php?page=examples_application and place it in the lib1 folder.
(Unfortunately GIT LFS (Large File support, https://git-lfs.com) would no way allow to upload this large file into this repository)

## Usage 1: Run/explore (adapted) NatTableExample.jar (NAT Table Example Application) 
The software.schmid.eclipse.nattable.tryout.Main can be run to run the NatTableExample.jar (the one from https://www.eclipse.org/nattable/documentation.php?page=examples_application).
This is the same as if you would run the EXE provided by the same page except the the EXE includes additionally RCP V4 examples. 
This has the advantage for me that I can explore the examples better with help of the debugger. Further I can create my own deviations of the sample code to try out while the dependencies are all here.

 
## Usage 2: Adapted personal exercises:
### 2.1 software.schmid.eclipse.nattable.tryout.hierarchicalheadersforrowandcolumn.ExpandColumnAndRowHeadersMain
Exercise: Create table that has expand collapse feature on columns and on rows.
