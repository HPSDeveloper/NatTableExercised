# My personal Nat Table exercises

This project contains my personal **NAT Table Exercises**. It is only meant for my personal documentation.
The source contains and references the **NatTableExample.jar* ([NAT Table Example Application](https://www.eclipse.org/nattable/documentation.php?page=examples_application))

## Usage 1: Run/explore (adapted) NatTableExample.jar (NAT Table Example Application) 
The software.schmid.eclipse.nattable.tryout.Main can be run to run the NatTableExample.jar (the one from https://www.eclipse.org/nattable/documentation.php?page=examples_application).
This is the same as if you would run the EXE provided by the same page except the the EXE includes additionally RCP V4 examples. 
This has the advantage for me that I can explore the examples better with help of the debugger. Further I can create my own deviations of the sample code to try out while the dependencies are all here.

 
## Usage 2: Adapted personal exercises:
### Usage 2.1 software.schmid.eclipse.nattable.tryout.hierarchicalheadersforrowandcolumn.ExpandColumnAndRowHeadersMain
Exercise: Create table that has expand collapse feature on columns and on rows.
